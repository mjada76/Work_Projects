  The project's main objective is to analyze healthcare plan characteristics focusing on Medicare-sponsored plans (MAPD and stand-alone PDP products)
  The first part of this project will analyze plan features that impact the Overall Star Rating set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
  Next, Star Rating analysis over the past few years will be used to identify patterns in Medicare health insurance and predict future trends.
